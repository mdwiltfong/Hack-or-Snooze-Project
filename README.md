## Hacker New Clone [Hack or Snooze]

Hey! Thanks for looking at this vanilla JS clone of Hacker News. This clone connects to the [Hack or Snooze API](https://hackorsnoozeapi.docs.apiary.io/#). This API authenticates users so they can post stories/articles, in which they would like to share with their community. In addition, when logged in your can view all the favorited articles. 

Take a look and let me know what you think! Quick word of caution, the API requires authentication to retrieve a user's data, but it does not encrypt passwords. It straight up stores tokens on your machine. I would recommend using a password you would never use. Like, "spam." 

Thanks again!
